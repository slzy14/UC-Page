           <h3>About</h3>
           <p>In 1986, the University of the Cordilleras, then known as the Baguio Colleges Foundation, became the first institution in Baguio City to offer a four-year course in Computer Science. Under the umbrella of the Arts and Sciences, this new division started with barely 100 students, 4 faculty members, and one course offering: Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science.<br><br>

With its transition from a division to a separate college in June 1995, the College grew to more than 1,200 students and 34 faculty members.<br><br>

In keeping with the philosophy of the University of the Cordilleras, the College of Information Technology and Computer Science has recognized its responsibility to respond to the changing needs of society, particularly in the field of Information Technology.<br><br>

The College is aware that today's technology revolves around the indispensability of the computer in the fields of computations, database systems, web & graphics, networking & security, mobile technology and digital arts.<br><br>

The present courses offered by the College are geared towards bolstering computing competencies, a vital role it plays in the community.<br><br>

In 2007, CHED Conferred the highest academic status to the college as "Center of Excellence". UC holds the distinction of being among the nation's top nine(9) in IT education.<br><br>

<b>To fulfill these, the College shall strive to:</b><br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Upgrade periodically the Institution's course offerings focusing on innovative tools, current trends, and industry requirements;</li><br>
  <li>Prepare the student to apply his/her acquired academic skills to his/her related profession with commitment and dedication;</li><br>
  <li>Excel in the use of Information Technology (IT) facilities, their prototypes and development, including evaluations and tests; and</li><br>
  <li>Become the Institution's number one provider of Information Technology tools to promote people productivity at lower costs.</li><br>
</ol>
